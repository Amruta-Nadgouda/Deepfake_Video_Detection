### Ensemble of CNN and RNN models

This directory has the CNN models such as ResNet50, ResNet152, ResNeXt50 and ResNeXt101, each ensembled with LSTM model.

ResXX_ModelTrain.ipynb files shows how to train the model and respective ResXX_Predict.ipynb files show how to use checkpoints to make predictions on the test data.

The checkpoints of the models can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16OANq0C_USZ66C5TX4HQcZsDFPk5bKs1?usp=sharing
